HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PROJECT  
 Team Requirements  
The Project aims to allow each team to design and develop a unique healthcare solution that enhances 
efficiency, accuracy, and overall patient and provider experience. Teams may choose any healthcare -
related system idea such as hospital management, telemedicine platforms, pharmacy systems, laboratory 
systems, rehabilitation centers, or wearable health monitoring dashboards , etc... The project should 
encompass various aspects of hea lthcare operations, including patient management, appointment 
scheduling, billing, and reporting  while  assisting  clinical staff in analyzing radiology scans with 
interactive visualization and intelligent diagnostic support.  
Each team must en sure their chosen system idea is unique and not duplicated by other teams.  
1. System Requirements : 
The system should encompass the following functionalities:  
a) User Authentication and Authorization:  
▪ Secure login for administrators, clinic al staff, and patients.  
▪ Role -based access control (Admin, Clinic al Staff, Patient).  
 
b) Patient Portal:  
▪ Patient registration and profile management.  
▪ Appointment scheduling and management.  
▪ Medical history and record access.  
▪ Prescription and treatment plan management.  
▪ Billing and payment processing.  
 
c) Appointment Management:  
▪ Schedule and manage appointments efficiently.  
 
d) Billing and Invoicing:  
▪ Generate accurate bills for services provided.  
 
e) Reporting and Analytics:  
▪ Generate reports for system  performance, patient statistics, and financial insights.  
▪ Provide data visualization for easy interpretation.  
 
f) CDSS Integration for Radiology Scans:  
▪ CDSS Module: Integrate a module that processes DICOM images from radiology scan s, 
providing analysis or insights based on clinical guidelines or machine learning models.  ▪ User Interface: Develop a web -based interface as part of the system ’s website, allowing 
seamless integration with patient profiles and ease of access for clinicians.  
 
g) DICOM Viewer:  
▪ Viewer Functionality: Implement an interactive DICOM vi ewer with basic tools like zoom, 
pan, rotate, and contrast adjustment for clinic al staff and patient use.  
▪ Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR): Enables users to view images in multiple planes (axial, 
sagittal, coronal) for improved spatia l orientation.  
▪ Volume Rendering: Provides 3D representations of anatomical structures for detailed 
analysis.  
▪ Image Adjustment and Enhancement: Windowing, leveling, sharpening, smoothing, and 
noise reduction filters for optimal image quality.  
 
h)      Bonus:  
▪ ICD-10 Integration:  Include ICD -10 codes in billing and reporting to standardize diagnoses 
and support accu rate medical documentation.  
▪ DICOM  Viewer : Include tools for annotations, measurements, and note -saving, with options 
to integrate annotated images into patient records.  
▪ Comparison Mode: Support side -by-side viewing of different DICOM images for historical 
or multi -modality comparison s, such as CT vs. MRI.  
 
2. Technology Stack : 
a) Programming Languages : Specify preferred languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, etc.).  
 
b) Frameworks and Libraries:  Choose suitable frameworks for frontend and backend 
development (e.g., React, Node.js,  Django, etc.).  For DICOM and CDSS integration,  utilize 
medical image processing libraries such as PyDICOM, SimpleITK, or deep learning frameworks 
like TensorFlow or PyTorch, for effective DICOM image handling and analysis.  
 
c) Database:  Select an appropriate database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, 
etc.) and design the database schema.  
 
3. Documentation : 
Ensure comprehensive documentation for code, database schema, system architecture, and user guides 
for administrators, clinic al staff, and patients.  
 
4. Project Management and Collaboration : 
Define tools and methodologies for project management, version control, and team collaboration (e.g., 
Git, Agile, etc.).  5. Project Timeline : 
NOTE:  Each team leader must submit Phase 0 for approval  by sending an email to Dr.  Eman A yman 
(eman.ayman@eng1.cu.edu.eg ) and Eng.  Yara Elshamy  (yara.elshamy@eng.cu.edu.eg ).
